**What is Run-Ahead?**

> [The Run Ahead feature calculates the frames as fast as possible in the background to "rollback" the action as close as possible to the input command requested.](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/runahead/)

I've enabled run-ahead on most of the 8 & 16-bit consoles and handhelds. A single frame (and using the second instance) is saved here, which dramatically improves input lag without affecting performance on a Pi3B+. More frames would require more hardware power, and may be achievable via overclocking.

    lr-snes9x2010 consistent 60.0-60.2 FPS @ 60.098801hz 

    lr-fceumm consistent 60.0-60.2 FPS @ 60.098801hz 

    lr-beetle-pce-fast consistent 60.1-60.2 @ 60.000000hz

    lr-genesis-gx-plus consistent 59.9-60.2 FPS @ 59.922741hz (both genesis and sega cd)

    lr-picodrive consistent 59.9-60.2 FPS @ 59.922741hz (master system, game gear, and 32X)

    lr-gambatte consistent 60.0-60.2 FPS @ 60.098801hz (SGB2 framerate)

    lr-mgba consistent 59.8-60.4 FPS @ 60.002220hz (Gamecube framerate)

**What Does This NOT Have?**

This doesn't have any ROMs (other than freeware test suites), BIOS files, music, screenshots, metadata, or videos concerning copywritten games. Other than the configurations and overlays, it has nothing that can't be downloaded through the repository or freeware.

___

**Where Can I Get It?**

You can download a premade image from Drive:

> NOTE: Please expand your file system via Raspi-Config after your first boot, and reboot!

**How do I install the Arcade Configuration Pack?**

These are the resolution-correct preset arcade configs for MAME/FBA including vertical games. There is roughly 38K files in there, spread out across several systems (arcade, fba, mame-libretro, and neogeo). Having these pre-installed would not allow either image to fit on the SD card used, and may not be needed for everyone. It's a fairly simple process that won't take more than a few minutes of your time.

* Drop to shell or connect via SSH, and navigate to root (cd /)
* Download the CRTPi-RCA_ArcadePack.zip with the command:

    sudo wget https://github.com/crtpi/CRTPi-Project/raw/master/CRTPi-RCA_ArcadePack.zip
	
* Unzip and overwrite files with the command:
    
	sudo unzip -o -q CRTPi-RCA_ArcadePack.zip
	
* Remove the zip with the command 

    sudo rm CRTPi-RCA_ArcadePack.zip
	
* Restore read/write access to the files you have overwritten with the command:

    sudo chmod a+rw -R /opt/retropie/configs/

**How can I take full advantage of the 480i/240p Switching?**

To force 480i for a system or game, you can create a '480i.txt' file inside the configuration folder of the system with a list of the file names (case insensitive, extension optional but recommended) you want to force. 

If you wish to force 480i for a whole system, you can write "all" inside the '480i.txt' file. 

Alternatively you can create a "240p.txt" file to force 480i to all games *except for* the ones inside the list.

You can read more about the script functionality [here](https://github.com/Sakitoshi/retropie-crt-tvout).

*Example:*

    /opt/retropie/configs/psx/480i.txt containing "Bloody Roar 2.PBP" to force 480i for the file "Bloody Roar 2.PBP"
    /opt/retropie/configs/psx/480i.txt containing "all" to force 480i for all the PlayStation games.
    /opt/retropie/configs/ports/kodi/480i.txt containing "all" to force 480i on Kodi.

**I have X Issue! Help?**

***I only have like 500mb of free space on my XXgb SD card!***

You need to expand your file system via Raspi-Config. Follow [these](https://crispconcept.com/pages/expand-sd-card) steps. 

***I want to switch back to lr-mupen64plus!***

* When launching an n64 game, mash buttons on the controller until the runcommand window comes up.  
* Select on "1  Set default emulator for n64" and choose "lr-mupen64plus"
* Then "Q  Exit (without launching)"
* Launch the game again -- it will launch in the chosen emulator at the proper resolution

***What A/V cable should I use for 3.5mm Composite?***

I recommend the Zune A/V cable or XBOX 360E cable, you can find them on eBay and Amazon.

***Samba Share won't work after I set up Wi-Fi!***

Samba share service starts on boot, pending that a network is available. Configure your Wi-Fi then reboot first, and if that doesn't fix it then go into Retropie Setup > Configuration/Tools > Samba > Install Samba.  Once it's complete, reboot and it should be golden.

***USB-Romservice and/or Retropie-Mount don't work!***

Follow [this guide](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki/Running-ROMs-from-a-USB-drive), but follow these steps before plugging in your thumb drive:

* Go to Retropie-Setup
* Update retropie install script
* Go to Manage Packages -> Optional Packages
* Scroll all the way down to usbromservice
* Uninstall usbromservice
* Install it again from Binary
* Once finished, choose Configuration, then Enable USB Romservice
* Reboot, and wait for it to fully boot in to ES
* Plug in USB stick (has to be FAT32) and WAIT A LONG TIME (if your stick has a light, wait for it to stop flashing)
